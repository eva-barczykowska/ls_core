# Staggered Caps (Part 2)
# Modify the method from the previous exercise so it ignores non-alphabetic
# characters when determining whether it should uppercase or lowercase each
# letter. The non-alphabetic characters should still be included in the return
# value; they just don't count when toggling the desired case.
