# The reverse_sentence method should return a new string with the words of its
# argument in reverse order, without using any of Ruby's built-in reverse methods.
# However, the code below raises an error. Change it so that it behaves as expected.

# my solution

# def reverse_sentence(sentence)
#   words = sentence.split(' ')
#   p words
#   reversed_words = ""
#
#   i = 0
#   while i < words.length
#     reversed_words = words[i] + " " + reversed_words
#     i += 1
#   end
#
#   reversed_words.rstrip
# end
#
# p reverse_sentence('how are you doing')
# # expected output: 'doing you are how'

# ls solution
