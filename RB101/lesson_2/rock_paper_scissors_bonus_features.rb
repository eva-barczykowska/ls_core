#1. Add Lizzard and Spock to my code

# 2. Typing the full word "rock" or "lizard" is tiring.
# Update the program so the user can type "r" for "rock," "p" for "paper," etc.
# Note that if you do bonus #1, you'll have two words that start with "s." How do you resolve that?

# 3. Keep score of the player's and computer's wins.
# When either the player or computer reaches three wins, the match is over,
# and the winning player becomes the grand winner.
# Don't add your incrementing logic to display_results.
# Keep your methods simple; they should perform one logical task â€” no more, no less.

# what defeats what - store this info in a hash
