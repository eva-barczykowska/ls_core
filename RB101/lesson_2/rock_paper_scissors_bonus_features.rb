# SCISSORS CUTS PAPER COVERS ROCK
# CRUSHES LIZARD POISONS SPOCK
# SMASHES SCISSORS DECAPITATES LIZZARD
# EATS PAPER DISPROVES SPOCK
# VAPORIZES ROCK CRASHES SCISSORS

# Requirements:
# 1. Add Lizard and Spock to my code
# 2. Update the program so the user can type "r" for "rock," "p" for "paper," etc.
# 3. Note that if you do bonus #1, you'll have two words that start with "s." How do you resolve that?
# 4. Keep score of the player's and computer's wins.
#    When either the player or computer reaches three wins, the match is over,
#    and the winning player becomes the grand winner.
#    Don't add your incrementing logic to display_results.
#    Keep your methods simple; they should perform one logical task â€” no more, no less.
