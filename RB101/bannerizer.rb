# PEDAC
# Problem
# -write a method that takes a string as an argument
# -print the string within a box
# -if a string is empty, print an empty box
# -you can assume that the message will always fit in the Terminal window
#
# Examples

# Data structures
# -input: string
# -output: string
#
# Algorithm
# -measure the string
# -prepare a space that is 2 spaces greater on the left and write
# -on the first line print + as the first and last character
# -print - in between then
# -second line is empty, except 2 pipes for the beginning and end of the line
# -Third line contains the quote,
#  with 1 space from the border at the beginning and at the end as well
# -Forth line is same as 2nd
# -last line is same as first
#
# make separate methods for all the lines, then call them in the final method
# called print_in_box(string)
# first time round doing this, without separate methods for each line:
