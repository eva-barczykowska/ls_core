# For a real challenge, try word wrapping very long messages so they appear
# on multiple lines, but still within a box.

# Algorithm
# -I need to truncate this message every 80 characters, including sides of the box
# -so 2 characters for borders and 2 for spaces on both sides of the text
# -so 80 - 4 = 76, after every 76 characters I would have to cut the text
# -but best would be to cut it on the last space before I reach 76 characters
# (so that the word is not cut incorectly like e.g. spont aneously).
#
# -first find out how long the string is, divide it by 74
# -accordingly change the definitions to account for printing 74 characters + spaces + borders
# -first and last will change only in the sense that 74 dashes will be printed in between 2 spaces and 2 borders (++)
# -2nd and penultimate method will change in the sense that it has 74 spaces + 2 more spaces and 2 borders (++)
# -3rd line will be printed once or more times, depending on the length of the string
# -we can split the string on spaces and print only until the last space before size 74
# -then print the rest etc. until the size of the array is reached
# how to find a space in regex? The space before character number 74
# print 78 characters and pad with 2 spaces (spaces are included in the 78 characters) and 2 borders

# with Regex it would be like this
# cut string on the last space before 76 characters
# print that cut part of the string padding it until 78 characters, (including 2 spaces) + 2 borders
# procdeed with cutting the string and printing parts of it until no string is left
# can I do it also without the Regex?
# so find the last character that is equal to " " before the index 75 and check which index is that
# cut the string from index 0 to that index, pad with spaces to 78, add 2 pipes as borders

Algorithm - Allison
  PROBLEM
    - input is a string of characters
    - output is an array of strings of 76 characters or less (chopped from the input string)


  ALGORITHM
    split input string into `arr` array of words
    make a copy of `arr` into `copyArr`
    initialize empty array `choppedStrings`
    initialize `charCounter` to 0
    begin iteration over `copyArr`
    initialize `line` to empty array
      begin iteration (while charCounter <= 76)
        slice off front of `arr` and store in `word`
        push `word` onto `line`
        add length of `word` onto `charCounter`
        if `charCounter` over 76
          remove `word` from `line` and unshift back onto `arr`
      end iteration

      join `line` on spaces and push string onto `choppedStrings`
    end iteration over `copyArr`

  PROBLEM
    - input is an array of chopped strings to a length of 76 chars or less
    - output will draw a border around that array's elements.

  ALGORITHM
    draw top line (80 chars)
    draw spacer line (80 chars)

    begin iteration over input arr
      drawText(currentArrElem)
    end iteration

    draw spacer line (80 chars)
    draw top line (80 chars)


  drawText(str)
    initalize `line` to `| `
    concat `str` to `line`
    initialize `lineLengh` to current line length
    initialize `padding` to `76 - lineLength`
    concat `padding` spaces onto `line`
    concat ` |` onto `line`
    return `line`

There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."
