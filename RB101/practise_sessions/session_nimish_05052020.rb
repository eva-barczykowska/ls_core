Your task is to Reverse and Combine Words.

Input: String containing different "words" separated by spaces

1. More than one word? Reverse each word and combine first with second, third
with fourth and so on...
(odd number of words => last one stays alone, but has to be reversed too)
2. Start it again until there's only one word without spaces
3. Return your resultâ€¦
=end

# Input: String
# Output: String

# Rules:
# - every word should be reversed
# - every other word joined
# - keep doing it until only 1 word without spaces is the result

# Algorithm:
# - start loop
#   - split the string into words -> `words`
#   - iterate and reverse each word
#   - join the words -> index 0 with index 1, 2 with 3.. an so on
#   - join all the words with a ' '
#   - break if array has only one word
# - end loop
# - return word jointed ' '
