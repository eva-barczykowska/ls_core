Problem
Write a 'swap' method that takes a string of words as a parameter and swaps the first and last letter of every word.
assume every word contains at least one letter, and every string contains at least one word.
The string will only contain words and spaces.

Examples/Data cases

swap('Oh what a wonderful day it is');  // "hO thaw a londerfuw yad ti si"
swap('Abcde');                          // "ebcdA"
swap('a');                              // "a"

Data Structures
The method will return a string
input: a string of words separated by spaces
output: a string of words separated by spaces but the first and last letter of every word will be swapped.

Algorithm
#split/join
- utilize the split method to split the string into an array of substrings containing the words separated by spaces
- use the each method to iterate over every elements (word) in the the array and assign the return value to the variable "swapped_str"
- initialize a variable "first" within the block to save the value of the first indexed element (first letter of the word)
- use indexed assignement to assign the value at index 0 (first letter) to the value at index -1 (last letter)
- index 0 and -1 now contain the same letter
-use indexed assignement to assign the value at index -1 to the value we saved to the variable first (original first letter)
- use the join method with a space as an argument to rejoin the elements of the array back into a string with the now swapped words separated by spaces

=end

def swap(str)
  swapped_str = str.split.each do |word|
    first = word[0]
    word[0] = word[-1]
    word[-1] = first
  end
  swapped_str.join(' ')

Problem
Write a method that takes an array of number and returns an array with the same
number of elements but the value
of every element is the running total from the original array.
running total? (based on test cases every element in array will be the element
added to the previous element in the original array)

Examples/Test cases

runningTotal([2, 5, 13]);             // [2, 7, 20]
runningTotal([14, 11, 7, 15, 20]);    // [14, 25, 32, 47, 67]
runningTotal([3]);                    // [3]
runningTotal([]);                     // []

Data structures
Returns an array of numbers
input: array of numbers
output: array of numbers with every element being the running total
if the input is an empty array return an empty array

Algorithm
- define a runningTotal method that takes an array (arr) as a argument
- use the each_with_index method to iterate over every element (num) of
-the array but have access to the index (idx) aswell and initialize
  the return value to the variable "running_total"
- initialize a variable "current_idx" to the integer 0
- start a loop
- if idx > 0 do num[current_idx] += num[idx]
  else do num[current_idx] = num[idx]
- add 1 to "current_idx"
- break when the running_total.size == arr.size
- return new array
