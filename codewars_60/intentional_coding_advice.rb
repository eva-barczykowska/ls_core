# - unhelpful habits:
# - "i will see" vs. irb, "I anticipate" / intentional coding

# WHAT TO DO
# - resolve all doubts BEFORE starting to code
# - test assumptions
# - how do I include a substring if it's equal to the str.size? - find out before coding
# - answer all questions BEFORE starting to code, this goes a long way
