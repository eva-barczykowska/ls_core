# Given a list and a number, create a new list that contains each number of list at most N times, without reordering.
# For example if the input number is 2, and the input list is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].
# With list [20,37,20,21] and number 1, the result would be [20,37,21].

P:
-method takes an array of numbers as an arg
-method returns new array that contains each number AT MOST n times (so not bigger than n times)

pÂ delete_nth([1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3],2) == [1,2,3,1,2,3]
=> n times is 2 so take [1,2,3,1,2], drop [1,2] and take 3. The result is 
[1,2,3,1,2,3]

DS:
input: array
output: array with each number repeated not more than n times

H: Iterate each number and as you do, count the count of this number in the result array. If it is more than n, don't add this number but move on, if it less than n, add this number and move on.

  A:
  -init  `result` []
  -iterate over the array and determine the count of the number at the current iteration - count in the `result`
  if it is less than n, add it and increase the counter
  -if it is equal to, just increase the counter to move on to the next number in the arg array

  -return `result`
