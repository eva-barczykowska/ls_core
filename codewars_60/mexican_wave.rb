35. Mexican Wave
(https://www.codewars.com/kata/58f5c63f1e26ecda7e000029/train/ruby)
6 kyu

In this Kata your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Mexican Wave.
You will be passed a string and you must return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is a person standing up.

 Rules:
1. The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty.
2. If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it as if it was an empty seat.

# *************Problem********************
# Overall goal: to take a string and return copies of the string in an array. each copy will have a diff ltr capitalized
# initial input: string
# overall output: array of strings
# explicit requirements:
# input string: all lowercase char, can be empty. if space, skip it, do not count it
# implicit requirements:
# array will contain the number of strings == to string size
#     if string has 5 chars, there will be 5 strings
# first string has first ltr capitalized
# 2nd string has 2nd ltr capitalized
# 3rd string has 3rd ltr capitalized
# 4th string has 4th ltr cap
# 5th string has 5th ltr cap
# array[0] has string[0] capitalized
# empty string returns empty array
# need to completely skip spaces - a word should not be added to the return array if curr
#   iteration is a space
# questions:
# ********** Examples/Test cases ************
# p wave("hello") == ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]
# ** H the E the L the L then O is cap
# p wave("codewars") == ["Codewars", "cOdewars", "coDewars", "codEwars", "codeWars", "codewArs", "codewaRs", "codewarS"]
# ** C the O then D etc is capitalized
# p wave("") == []
# ** empty string returns empty array
# p wave("two words") == ["Two words", "tWo words", "twO words", "two Words", "two wOrds", "two woRds", "two worDs", "two wordS"]
# ** the space is ignored
# p wave(" gap ") == [" Gap ", " gAp ", " gaP "]
# ** There is 1 space before and after gap. The space is ignored, no string is returned for that iteration.
# then G then A then P is upcased, then ending space is ignored So only 3 strings are returned, one for
# each letter. no string returned if ther eis a space in orig string,
# *************Data Structure**************
# string > array of strings
# ***************Algorithm*****************
# Overall approach: initialize return array > 0 up to string size  as index> iterate over int > take string and capitalize
# the indexed char > add to return array > return return array
# */ initialize result array to empty

# details:
# */ iterate 0 to string size, with block
# details: upto

# */ inside block: need to skip the iteration if the current iterated char is empty string
# details: next if word[int] == ' '

# */ inside block: take string and upcase the element of current iteration number
# details: assign string[0] to string[0].upcase

# */ add word to result array
# details:
# */ then downcase word to reset it/start with all downcase letters

# details:
# */ return value is result array (array of strings/Mexican wave)

# PEDAC TEMPLATE
#
# ************** Problem **************
# write a method
# -the method takes a string as an argument (1 lowercase string, could be consisting of multiple words like test case 4)
# -the method returns an array of strings such as that the array string is repeated but when it's repeated, the next
# consecutive letter is upcased, as if this was Mexican wave at a football stadium and the person was standing up
# -however, when upcasing, spaces within the string have to be ignored, like in the last example
# ************** Examples **************
# p wave("hello") #== ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]
# => coz every consecutive letter has been upcased in every consecutive word
# => specifically, in word at index 0, it is letter at index 0, in word at index 1 it is letter at index 1, etc.

# p wave("codewars") == ["Codewars", "cOdewars", "coDewars", "codEwars", "codeWars", "codewArs", "codewaRs", "codewarS"]
# => same as above but it is basically a longer word

# p wave("") == []
# => here we are accounting for an empty string

# p wave("two words") == ["Two words", "tWo words", "twO words", "two Words", "two wOrds", "two woRds", "two worDs", "two wordS"]
# => here we actually have 2 words and we need to ignore the space so that we can upcase correctly
# => if there is an empty seat, it is ignored while doing a mexican wave at a football stadium

# p wave(" gap ") #== [" Gap ", " gAp ", " gaP "]
# => one word but there is a space before and after so we need to ignore it
#
# ************** Data Structures **************
# Input: a string, always lowercase
#   Middle: how Iâ€™m going to get from where I am to where I want to be
# Output: an array of strings, in which every consecutive letter is upcased, spaces are ignored while upcasing
# ************** Algorithm **************
# -account for an empty string and later see if maybe the code accounts for it by default (refactor)
# -create an empty `results` array
# -start iteration (using rage for example) and get access to the index
# -skip a given index in the string if the character at that index is a space
# -upcase character at that index (which you got from iteration using rage (0...str.size))
# -add string with the upcased index to the `results` array
# -now downcase the string so that we have a string like an original string argument to work with
# ************** Code **************
#
# ************** Refactor **************

# ************** Problem **************
# -create a method that takes a string returns a Mexican wave

# ************** Algorithm **************
# -initialize `result` array
# iterate from 0 to str.size -1 and grab that index
# move to the next index if character at that index is a space
#
# then using String element reference grab the character at a certain index and upcase it
# append the string with the upcased character to the results array
