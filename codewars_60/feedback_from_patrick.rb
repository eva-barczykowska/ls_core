-focus on the process of debugging, line by line
-be methodical and don't be afraid of it
-test as you go, test every assumption
-at the interview, skim all the questions
-you can comment out ### the portions of the algorithm that are already done

- Think of the interview as a presentation of your process; you want to make
it transparent what you're thinking and why, and also package it in a way
that is easy for them to understand and follow. While thinking, talk through
your solution process. Once you've settled on something, state it clearly,
and then type it out. Bite-sized ideas are great. Say a sentence or two about
each line of algorithm or code that you type, before you type. Then type in
silence to give you and the interviewer a moment of silence to process.
- When testing as you code, Always communicate what you *expect* the code to do
*before* running the code. This demonstrates that you are in control of the
code
- Test as often as possible for each unique bit of code; err on the side of
testing too much
