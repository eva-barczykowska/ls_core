# Write a method named to_weird_case that accepts a string, and
# returns the same sequence of characters with every 2nd character
# in every third word converted to uppercase. Other characters
# should remain the same.

# Examples:

# p to_weird_case('Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing') ==
#                 'Lorem Ipsum iS simply dummy tExT of the pRiNtInG'
# p to_weird_case(
#   'It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted') ==
#   'It is a long established fAcT that a rEaDeR will be dIsTrAcTeD'
# p to_weird_case('aaA bB c') == 'aaA bB c'
# p to_weird_case(
#   'Miss Mary Poppins word is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious') ==
#   'Miss Mary POpPiNs word is sUpErCaLiFrAgIlIsTiCeXpIaLiDoCiOuS'

# The tests above should print "true".

# -initialize an empty `new_str` to store the result
#
# -split string into words
# -iterate over each word
# -if the word is not every third word, just add it to the new array as it is
# -how to find out that the word is every third???
# -initialize `target_indices` and append the right numbers there, going from 2 to string size.
#  i.e. 2, 5, 8, 11 (num + 3) - these are indices
# -once calculated the target_indices, iterate over the words with index and if index of a given word doesn't belong to target_indices,
#  just add the word as it is to new_str array
# -if index of the word does belong to indices, iterate over this word's chars with index and upcase every char at odd index
#  then join characters append this word to new_str

# -join the all words so that we have a string again
# -return `new_str`
